// Dinner Guests: Working with one of the programs from Exercises 14 through 18, print a message indicating the number of people you are inviting to dinner.
var guest = ["Emaan", "Nadia", "Rukhsana"];
console.log(guest.length, "people are invited to dinner");
// Is question me hum variable name k sath length lagayengay to humain array ki length ka pata chal jayega i.e. number of people invited to dinner
