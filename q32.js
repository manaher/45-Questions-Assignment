// Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
// • Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
// • Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.
// • Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.
var current_users = ['saba', 'ahmed', 'babar', 'raza', 'hadi'];
var new_users = ['ali', 'hina', 'raza', 'hadi', 'ifra'];
new_users.forEach(function (newUser) {
    if (current_users.some(function (currentUser) { return currentUser.toLowerCase() === newUser.toLowerCase(); })) {
        console.log("".concat(newUser, " will need to enter a new username."));
    }
    else {
        console.log("".concat(newUser, " is available."));
    }
});
